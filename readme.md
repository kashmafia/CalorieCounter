# Calorie Counter App

## Summary
This app aims to be an SMS based calorie counter. The goal is to use the user's phone messaging app to prompt a daily input for allotted calories and then let the user text food they eat throughout the day to calculate and then track their nutrition goals throughout the day.

## Future Feature Wishlist
* ML/AI feature to recognize food and calculate the nutrition through a picture
* Database for scalability?
